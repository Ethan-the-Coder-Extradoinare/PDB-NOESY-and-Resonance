# PDB-NOESY-and-Resonance


Each folder will represent a PBD ID for a protein with NMR data, and will show NOESY data and Resonance Assignments.
Collection from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AYzBDkg_tVE5UEyLrrYx-Rbx39lLVAJJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115126507232032645619&rtpof=true&sd=true

Resonance and NOESY peak list data will most easily be found in the BMRB file. Items without NOESY will be marked (N) and without resonance assignments will be marked (R).
